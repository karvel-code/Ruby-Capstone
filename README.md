# ruby_capstone- linters for Ruby

Its a customised linter for ruby.The whole idea of writing code to check another code is intriguing at the same time cognitively demanding. Building Linters for Ruby, the project provides feedback about errors or warning in code. The project was built completely with Ruby following all possible best practices. Rubocop was used as a code-linter alongside Gitflow to ensure I maintain good coding standards.
